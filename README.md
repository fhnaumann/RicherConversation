# Richer Conversation

### A concise library to improve the (old) [Conversation API](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/conversations/package-summary.html) in [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/).

---

Depending on the project with maven:
```
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.github.wand555</groupId>
  <artifactId>richerconversation-api</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.3</version>
</dependency>
```

This library is designed to bring the useful, underused, but also old Conversation API up to date.
The main features are
- BaseComponent support for prompt questions
- additional keywords like showing the history of questions and answers (only specifying an escape sequence is allowed normally)
- support for custom keywords with custom actions
- pre-written Prompts which are used often

Head over to the [wiki](../../wiki) to see some examples.
